        <h2>Springboks History</h2>
        <p>The Springboks, South Africa’s national rugby team, have a rich history dating back to 1891. Initially gaining recognition in the early 20th century, they became one of the most dominant teams in world rugby. Their iconic nickname comes from the springbok antelope, symbolizing national pride.</p>
        <p>Despite international success, the team faced isolation during the apartheid era, missing the first two Rugby World Cups due to boycotts. They re-emerged triumphantly by winning the 1995 World Cup, symbolizing national unity under Nelson Mandela’s leadership.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Springboks have won four Rugby World Cup titles (1995, 2007, 2019, 2023), making them one of the most successful teams in rugby history. Known for their physicality, strong forward play, and intense rivalries, especially with New Zealand’s All Blacks, the Springboks are a symbol of resilience and pride for South Africa.</p>
